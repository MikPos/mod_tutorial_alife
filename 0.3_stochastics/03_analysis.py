Stochastic Simulation Tutorial - Analysis

This script demonstrates how to run multiple stochastic simulations and perform
comprehensive statistical analysis on the results. It combines simulation
execution with data extraction and statistical analysis to provide insights
into the formose reaction network dynamics.

The analysis includes:
- Multiple independent simulations (50 runs)
- Data extraction from simulation traces
- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals
- Visualization of concentration profiles and species clustering
- Top species selection based on average concentrations

This represents the complete workflow from simulation to analysis.
