Stochastic Simulation Tutorial - Introduction

This script demonstrates the basic usage of MÃ˜D's stochastic simulation capabilities
for modeling the formose reaction network. It sets up a simple simulation with
formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde as starting materials and runs a single simulation
to show the basic workflow.

The formose reaction is a complex autocatalytic reaction that can produce various
sugars from formaldehyde, making it relevant for understanding prebiotic chemistry
and the origin of life.

Key components:
- Initial molecules: formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde
- Reaction rules: keto-enol isomerization and aldol addition (both forward and reverse)
- Constraints: prevent formation of certain forbidden subgraphs and limit molecule size
- Simulation: runs for 100 time units using mass-action kinetics
