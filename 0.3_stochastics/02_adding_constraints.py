"""
Stochastic Simulation Tutorial - Adding Constraints

This script demonstrates how to run multiple stochastic simulations with constraints
to study the formose reaction network. It runs 50 independent simulations to
generate statistical data about the reaction dynamics.

The constraints help ensure that only chemically reasonable molecules are formed
during the simulation, preventing the generation of unrealistic or unstable
intermediates that would not occur in real chemistry.

Key features:
- Multiple independent simulations (50 runs)
- Constraint application to limit reaction network growth
- Statistical sampling of reaction dynamics
- Memory management to handle large numbers of simulations
